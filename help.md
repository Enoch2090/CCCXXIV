## A Small Poem

### At the Student Poetry Reading



BY [KIM STAFFORD](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/kim-stafford)

*I guess you could call me broken,*

says one. *I’m still lonely,* says another,

*but now I can name it with a song.*

*In my poem,* says another,

*I can forget I am forgotten. Now*

*I understand being misunderstood,*

says another. And another says,

in a bold, undeniable voice of power,

*I won’t step down from myself again.*

And they are beautiful, beautiful,

standing one by one at the mic

where they have come forth at last

from behind the curtain.
